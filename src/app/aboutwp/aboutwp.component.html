<h1>Jacob Sheikh, the great prophet</h1>
<h2>
  Jacob Sheikh is our allfather, for he is the sheperd guiding us through the
  darkness. With his hunky honches and infinite wisdom, he cradles us to sleep.
  To forsake Jacob is sacrilege, all non-believes shall have their ribs taken
  without anaesthesia.
